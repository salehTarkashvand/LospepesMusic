# LospepesMusic

LospepesMusic is a music streaming application developed using React and Redux. This project includes various features such as state management with Redux, API simulation with MSW, styling with Tailwind CSS, and HTTP requests with Axios.


## Features

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For modular state management.
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For API simulation and testing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern and responsive UI design.
- **Axios**: For efficient HTTP requests.

## Usage

### React

React is used for building the user interface. It allows you to create reusable components. Below is an example of a simple React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>LospepesMusic</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;

```
### Redux
Redux is used for state management. The structure includes actions, reducers, and store. Here is an example of a Redux slice:
```javaScript
// src/features/player/playerSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const playerSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'player',
  initialState: {
    isPlaying: false,
    currentTrack: null,
  },
  reducers: {
    play: (state, action) => {
      state.isPlaying = true;
      state.currentTrack = action.payload;
    },
    pause: (state) => {
      state.isPlaying = false;
    },
  },
});

export const { play, pause } = playerSlice.actions;
export default playerSlice.reducer;
```
### MSW (Mock Service Worker)
MSW is used for API simulation and testing. It allows you to mock network requests. Here is an example of setting up MSW:

```javascript
// src/mocks/browser.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw';
import { handlers } from './handlers';

export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers);
```
### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used for styling. It allows you to apply pre-defined classes for rapid UI development. Here is an example of a styled component:

```javascript
// src/components/Button.js
import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;


```
### Axios
Axios is used for making HTTP requests. It provides features like request and response interception. Here is an example of an Axios request:

```javascript
// src/services/api.js
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
});

export const fetchSongs = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/songs');
  return response.data;
};

```
